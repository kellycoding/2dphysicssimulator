# 2D Physics Simulator

A customizable playground with a fully functioning kinematics engine. Players can adjust the playground gravity and the object mass, and reset the scenario at their will. Players can test collisions with the edges of the sandbox by dragging the object around with their mouse, or using the left and right arrow keys to manufacture horizontal velocity. Players are able to visualize the dynamics of the object through the numerical display of the object's variables, including kinetic and potential energy.

To play: Simply run main.py in python. massspectrometer.py is a broken, mid-crashout side project.

## Requirements

Pygame: Library used by the game.
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```
